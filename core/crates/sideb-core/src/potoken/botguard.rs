//! BotGuard minting on a dedicated thread, under `rustypipe-botguard` (deno_core + JSDOM).
//!
//! **Not a webview, deliberately.** googlevideo honours the pots built from a ~62-byte
//! `/GenerateIT` integrity token and rejects the ones built from a 65-66 byte token, and which
//! class you get is decided by the BotGuard snapshot. A minimal-DOM runtime lands in the accepted
//! class roughly one bootstrap in three; every real browser engine measured 0 in 25 (WebKitGTK,
//! headless Chromium, headed GPU Chromium, including an exact reproduction of Metrolist's Android
//! recipe). So we mint here instead, and re-roll the bootstrap until the class is right, which the
//! pot's own length tells us before it is ever attached to a URL. Evidence and the harness:
//! `progress/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` KI-1, with the harness in `progress/active/webremix-403-harness/`.
//!
//! `deno_core::JsRuntime` is `!Send`, so the runtime lives on a thread of its own and is driven
//! over a channel. That thread is a **process-wide singleton, created once and never replaced**,
//! and this is not a nicety: V8's default platform write-protects its JIT pages with a memory
//! protection key, and `PKRU` (which grants access to that key) is per-thread and inherited only
//! at clone time. So "all threads using v8 [must be] created as descendent threads of the thread
//! that called `v8::Initialize`" (rusty_v8 `new_default_platform` docs). A second thread spawned
//! later from a tokio worker is not one of those, and the first thing V8 touches on it faults with
//! `SIGSEGV / SEGV_PKUERR`, killing the whole app. That was issue #133: play a track (thread 1
//! initialises V8), leave it idle past the 10 minute teardown, play again, instant crash.
//!
//! So the thread stays; the isolate is what comes and goes. Dropping the [`Minter`] tells the
//! thread to drop its `Botguard`, which frees the isolate, and the next bootstrap builds another
//! one on that same thread. Handles carry a generation so a late `Shutdown` from a replaced
//! `Minter` cannot free the runtime that replaced it.
