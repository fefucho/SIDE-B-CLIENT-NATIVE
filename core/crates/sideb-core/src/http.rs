//! The app's one outbound HTTP client.
//!
//! There used to be six of these inside `src-tauri` (orchestrator, PoToken, cipher fetcher, cipher
//! config, lyrics, and Last.fm twice), each built from its own `Client::builder()`. `reqwest` pools
//! connections and holds its TLS config per client, so that was six rustls configs, six connection
//! pools and six sets of idle sockets to the same handful of Google hosts.
//!
//! Everything the separate clients were configured for (a User-Agent, a timeout) is per-request
//! state, so it moved to the call sites. The User-Agent is deliberately NOT a default here: what
//! YouTube serves for `player.js` depends on it, so it should be visible at the fetch rather than
//! inherited from somewhere else and quietly lost in a later edit.
//!
//! `crates/innertube` keeps its own client on purpose. It is the other side of the transport
//! boundary (context/11) and it configures a proxy per session, which is client-level state.
